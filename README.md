# Congitive capacity of neural networks
Orestis Bastas


## Abstract
This report explores the cognitive capacity of standard and popular neural network archi-
tectures by replicating cognition ability tests performed on insects, most notably bees, on
neural network models. The insectsâ€™ vision systems are reviewed, as well as the experiments
designed to test their cognitive abilities based on visual stimulus.  Three experiments were
chosen to be replicated for neural network implementations,  Y-maze,  Delayed Match to
Sample, and Camouflage.  These experiments are based on pattern recognition, but have
different goals.  Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory net-
works (LSTM) are used to create the models.  The bees outperform the networks on all
tasks, needing less trials and less data to achieve high accuracy.  The models do manage
to  achieve  high  accuracy  scores  in  these  tasks  with  larger  datasets  and  longer  training
periods.  The bees also show greater generalisation and understanding of abstract concepts
compared to the artificial neural netwroks.  Further variations on these experiments are
created to test whether the tuned parameters of the networks incorporate information on
the abstract concepts of the experiments.  No conclusive evidence is found to support that
the neural networks can generalise the concepts of sameness or symbolic matching, on sets
of patterns previously unseen.  However, a few hints of higher performance in these tasks
is reported, but further investigation on them needs to be carried out.
