Congitive capacity of neural networks

## Abstract

This report explores the cognitive capacity of standard and popular neural network architectures by replicating cognition ability tests performed on insects, most notably bees, on neural network models. The insects' vision systems are explored, as well as the experiments used to test their cognitive abilities based on visual stimulus. Three experiments were chosen to be replicated for neural network implementations, Y-maze, Delayed Match to Sample, and Camouflage. These experiments are based on pattern recognition, but have different goals. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) are used to create the models. The bees outperform the networks on all tasks, needing less trials and less data to achieve high accuracy. The models do manage to achieve high accuracy scores in these tasks with larger datasets and longer training periods. Further variations on these experiments are created to test whether the tuned parameters of the networks incorporated information on the abstract concepts of the experiments. No conclusive evidence is found to support that the neural networks can generalise the concepts of sameness or symbolic matching, on sets of patterns previously unseen. However, a few hints of higher performance in these tasks is reported, but further investigation on them needs to be carried out.
